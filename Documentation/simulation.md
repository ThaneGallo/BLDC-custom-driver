# Simulation

## Intro
Originally I was deciding between Simulink and LabVIEW for testing and modelling the control system but I had decided to use Simulink as it gave me ample resources for learning and I had quickly completed the fundamentals course provided by Mathworks. As I am using a trial license I do not have access to all of the handy prebuilt blocks for components such as motors and motor drivers. This would lead me to model them myself using papers published about the subject matter as a reference for the mathmetcial models of the components (Can be found below)

## Important Considerations
This is modelling an IDEAL system as it makes certain assumptions in the modelling that would be untrue in the working model. For example, it assumes that mutual inductence between the coils within the motor is 0 and that energy transfer is perfect which are both not true. This was just used as a basis to begin modelling and creation of the PID control loop.
